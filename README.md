# Machine Learning Projects Overview

Worked on multiple end-to-end Machine Learning projects across regression, classification, clustering, and NLP, delivering complete pipelines from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Key Projects & Impact:

### 1) Smart Study Score Predictor (Regression)
- Built a Linear Regression model on a 1,000-record academic dataset (Kaggle – Students Performance).
- Engineered a target feature (average_score) and applied one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
- Evaluated using:
  - MAE: 10.49
  - RMSE: 13.40
  - R²: 0.16
- Extracted insights showing test-preparation courses and parental education positively affect performance.

### 2) AI Health Analyst – Heart Disease Prediction (Classification)
- Developed a Logistic Regression model on 1,025 patient records (UCI Heart Disease dataset).
- Achieved:
  - Accuracy: 80.98%
  - Recall: 91.43%
- Implemented feature scaling, confusion matrix analysis, and feature importance.
- Validated results with multiple metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-score).

### 3) Customer Segmentation using K-Means (Unsupervised Learning)
- Clustered mall customers using annual income and spending behavior.
- Applied the Elbow Method to determine optimal clusters (k = 5).
- Identified high-value, budget-conscious, and impulsive customer segments for targeted marketing strategies.

### 4) Fake News Detection using NLP (Text Classification)
- Built and compared multiple models on 44,898 news articles.
- Achieved 99.73% accuracy using Linear SVM (outperforming Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes).
- Performed deep text preprocessing and interpretability analysis on linguistic patterns.
- Validated against data leakage with sanity checks and feature ablation.
